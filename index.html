    <h1>Website Title Text</h1>

    <p class="main-paragraph">Dog is considered to be the most preferable pet because of its faithfulness and loyalty. It is known as man’s best friend and that is one of the reasons for it being so popular among other pets. It can be distinguished in many ways, according to its character, by its genetic qualities and other traits.</p>

<p class="second-paragraph">Dogs are broadly classified in two categories – working dogs and companion dogs. Companion dogs are used for their companionship as pets, just for the pleasure of their company while working dogs do some sort of work for humans other than just entertaining them.</p>
